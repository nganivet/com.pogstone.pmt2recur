  <name>Payment 2 Recurring Contribution</name>
  <description>This allows a back-office user to associate a contribution with an automated recurring contribution schedule. This can be useful when an automated contribution schedule experiences a missed transaction (such as the credit card was over its spending limit, or a Direct Debit failed) and the donor/member has mailed a check to cover the missing transaction. </description>

  <comments>This has been tested with Authorize.net, PayPalPro, and eWay. Since there is no payment processor-sepcific code in this extension, it should work with any payment processor that offers automated recurring contributions, but further testing is needed to verify this assumption.</comments>
